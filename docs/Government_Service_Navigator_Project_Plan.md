# Government Service Navigator — Project Workflow & Documentation Plan
SE3090 Assignment 1 | 9-Week Plan (31 July – 30 September 2026)

---

## 1. Domain Framing

**Problem:** Citizens don't know which government procedure applies to their situation, what documents are required, what fees apply, or what the status of their application is. Officers, in turn, need a structured queue of applications to review, verify, and approve rather than ad-hoc paper/email trails.

**Product:** A platform where a citizen describes their need in plain language (e.g. "I want to register a small business" or "I lost my driving licence"), gets a guided procedure with a document checklist, submits an application/appointment, and tracks it end-to-end — while officers review, verify, and approve through a web dashboard.

### User Roles (minimum 3 required — this design uses 4)
| Role | Responsibilities | Client |
|---|---|---|
| **Citizen/Applicant** | Search services, get guidance, submit applications, upload documents, pay fees, track status | Flutter |
| **Verifying Officer** | Review submitted applications, verify documents, approve/reject agent recommendations | React |
| **Department Admin** | Manage service catalog, fees, eligibility rules, view analytics/reports | React |
| **System Admin** | Manage users, roles, audit logs, system configuration | React |

### Four Business Components (one per student)
| Student | Component | Core Entities |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Service Catalog & Eligibility Guidance** | Services, Procedures, EligibilityRules, DocumentRequirements, FeeSchedules |
| **B** | **Application & Case Management** | Applications, ApplicationSteps, Documents, AppointmentSlots, StatusHistory |
| **C** | **Verification & Compliance** | VerificationTasks, OfficerReviews, ComplianceChecks, RejectionReasons, AuditLogs |
| **D** | **Payments, Notifications & Analytics** | Payments, Notifications, ReportSnapshots, ServiceUsageStats |

Each component needs ≥4 API endpoints and ≥1 business-specific operation beyond CRUD (e.g. Component A: an eligibility-scoring endpoint; Component C: a bulk-verification endpoint).

### Third-Party Integration
Pick one and route it through ASP.NET Core:
- **Payment sandbox** (Stripe test mode) for permit/licence fees, **or**
- **Maps API** for nearest government office/branch locator, **or**
- **SMS/Email (Twilio/SendGrid sandbox)** for status notifications.

(Maps + Notifications together is a strong combo if you want two lightweight integrations — but only one is required.)

## 2. Agentic AI Subsystem — "Navigator Agent Workflow"

**Objective given to the system:** *"Help this citizen complete [X] procedure."*

### Four Distinct Agents (required minimum)
| Agent | Responsibility | Input → Output | Tools it may call |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Intake & Planning Agent** | Parses the citizen's free-text need, matches it to a service in the catalog, produces a structured multi-step plan | Free text query → structured plan (service ID, steps, assigned agents) | `search_service_catalog` |
| **2. Eligibility & Document Analysis Agent** | Checks citizen data against eligibility rules, determines missing documents | Plan + citizen profile → eligibility result, missing-doc list | `check_eligibility_rules`, `get_document_requirements` |
| **3. Action/Tool Agent** | Prepares the draft application: pre-fills form fields, calculates fees, proposes an appointment slot | Eligibility result → draft application object | `calculate_fee`, `find_appointment_slot`, `prefill_application` |
| **4. Validation & Safety Agent** | Runs deterministic checks (schema, business rules, duplicate-application check) and prepares the case for human approval | Draft application → validated application or rejection reasons | `validate_schema`, `check_duplicate_application` |

**High-impact action requiring human approval:** final submission of the completed application into the officer's queue (this could commit fee charges or reserve a limited appointment slot) — an authorized Verifying Officer must approve, reject, or request revision before it's marked accepted.

**Persisted workflow state:** workflow ID, objective, plan, each agent's output, tool call results, validation results, approval decision, final outcome — stored in a `WorkflowExecutions` (or similar) PostgreSQL table, not in hidden reasoning.

**Safe failure example:** if the citizen's query doesn't match any known service, or eligibility fails, the agent returns a clear "no matching procedure" or "not eligible — missing X" result rather than guessing.

## 3. Required Cross-Platform Workflow (the one you'll demo)

```
1. Flutter (Citizen)        → describes need, submits application + documents
2. ASP.NET Core             → authenticates, validates, stores request
3. PostgreSQL               → persists application + audit fields
4. Agentic AI (4 agents)    → plans, checks eligibility, drafts, validates
5. React (Officer)          → reviews agent's draft + evidence, approves/rejects/revises
6. Shared status update     → citizen's Flutter app shows updated status in real time
```

This single path is your **minimum acceptance workflow** — get it airtight before polishing anything else.

## 4. Nine-Week Execution Plan

| Week | Dates (approx.) | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | 31 Jul – 6 Aug | Domain lock-in, requirements, roles, GitHub repo setup | ER diagram draft, initial ADR entries, GitHub repo + project board, role split |
| **2** | 7–13 Aug | Database schema, EF Core migrations, JWT auth skeleton | PostgreSQL schema + migrations, working auth endpoints |
| **3** | 14–20 Aug | Core CRUD APIs per component; React & Flutter skeletons | 4 components' basic endpoints, Swagger docs, app shells with routing |
| **4** | 21–27 Aug | Design & build the 4 agents; tool functions; local agent testing | Agent framework chosen (justify in ADR), agents callable individually |
| **5** | 28 Aug – 3 Sep | Wire agents into ASP.NET Core; persisted workflow state; approval endpoint | End-to-end workflow (Step 3 above) working with one golden case |
| **6** | 4–10 Sep | Full React officer dashboard; full Flutter citizen flows; device feature | Approve/reject/revise UI, document upload, notifications, maps/camera/etc. |
| **7** | 11–17 Sep | Testing sweep: unit, integration, agent evaluation, performance; CI pipeline green | Test suites for all layers, GitHub Actions CI passing, agent golden-case tests |
| **8** | 18–24 Sep | Deployment (API, DB, React live; Flutter APK); write all documentation | Live URLs, Swagger URL, APK, README, ADRs, reports drafted |
| **9** | 25–30 Sep | Freeze features, rehearse demo, finalize individual reports, record demo video, submit | Consolidated PDF, demo video, final submission by leader |

**Rule of thumb:** don't start polishing UI until the Week 5 end-to-end workflow works — that single path is worth the most marks (Integrated Architecture criterion, 10 marks; Agentic AI Contribution, 12 marks each).

## 5. Documentation Package

Everything below goes into **one consolidated PDF**, named `SE3090_GroupNumber.pdf`.

### 5.1 README / Technical Documentation (Group Report)
- Project overview & business problem (Government Service Navigator, the citizen-navigation gap)
- User roles, features, technology justification
- System architecture diagram + Agentic AI architecture diagram (label all 4 agents, tools, state store)
- Database ER diagram + repository structure
- Installation: env variables, DB setup, startup order (DB → API → Agentic AI service → React → Flutter)
- API documentation (or link to Swagger), test instructions, deployment instructions, live URLs, test accounts for each role
- Individual contributions summary table, challenges, security considerations
- Consolidated **group AI usage declaration**

### 5.2 Architecture Decision Record (ADR) — 3 to 6 decisions, one page each
Minimum required decisions:
1. React state-management approach (e.g. Context API vs Redux Toolkit) — for officer dashboard
2. Flutter state-management approach — for citizen app
3. Agentic AI framework & orchestration method (e.g. LangGraph) — why it fits a 4-agent plan/approve pattern
4. Database schema strategy for agent workflow state (e.g. JSONB column vs normalized tables for plan/steps)
5. Cloud deployment platform choice

**ADR template (repeat per decision):**
```
Decision: [short title]
Context: What problem forced this decision?
Options Considered: [2-3 options with pros/cons]
Decision: [what you chose]
Consequences: [trade-offs accepted]
```

### 5.3 Individual Report Sections (one per student)
Each student's section must include:
- Contribution statement + owned component (A/B/C/D) and technical work done
- Key commit/PR/test evidence (link or screenshot references)
- Challenges & learning
- Individual AI usage log (date, tool/model, task, what was produced, what was changed/rejected, how verified)
- ~1-page AI reflection (which tools, what they got right/wrong, what you changed, what you learned)
- Signed declaration

### 5.4 Testing, Agentic AI Evaluation, Performance, Deployment Reports
- **Testing report (6–10 pages):** backend/DB/React/Flutter/E2E test evidence, coverage summary
- **Agentic AI evaluation report (5–8 pages):** golden-case results, rule-based assertions + schema validation (not LLM-as-judge alone), prompt-injection resistance test, failure-recovery test

## 6. Immediate Next Steps
1. Confirm the exact service scope (pick 3–5 real procedures to model, e.g. driving licence renewal, business registration, land permit, passport application) so eligibility rules and documents feel authentic.
2. Split the 4 components across the team and start Week 1 tasks today.
3. Open the GitHub repo now — don't wait for the design to be "finished"; commit history from Day 1 is graded.
